## 🎯 **Core Features Deep Dive**

### 1. 🧪 **Interactive Simulations**

**What it is:** Virtual science labs where students can conduct experiments safely.

**How it works:**
1. Student selects a simulation (Chemistry, Physics, Biology)
2. AI generates interactive lab environment
3. Student drags equipment, mixes chemicals, observes results
4. Real-time feedback and hints guide learning

**Example Simulation Flow:**
```
🔬 Chemistry Lab Simulation
├── Equipment Selection (beakers, test tubes, chemicals)
├── Chemical Mixing (drag & drop interface)
├── Reaction Observation (color changes, bubbles, heat)
└── Results Analysis (AI explains what happened)
```

**Try it:** Login as a student → Navigate to Simulations → Select any experiment

---

### 2. 🎮 **AI Game Generator**

**What it is:** Students describe a game they want to play, AI creates it instantly.

**How it works:**
1. Student types: *"I want a game about photosynthesis"*
2. AI generates HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the game
3. Game runs immediately in the browser
4. Student plays and learns simultaneously

**Example Prompts:**
- *"Create a math puzzle game for grade 3"*
- *"Make a physics game about gravity and motion"*
- *"Design a biology game about cell structure"*

**Try it:** Login as a student → Simulations → "Create Custom Game" → Type your idea

---
